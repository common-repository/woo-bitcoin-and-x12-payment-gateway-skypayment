With SkyPayment Plugin you are able to accept Cryptocurrency Payment in your Woocommerce Online Shop.

== Description ==

**SkyPayment X12 billing method for Woocommerce**

Use SkyPayment to offer your customers the possibility of paying with X12 coins. Billing is fully automated by our cryptocurrency payment platform and the associated accounting system.
Successful payments from customers can be instantly converted to FIAT, and you can receive payments in Euros and US dollars directly to your bank or PayPal account.
Alternatively, you can opt for a payout in X12 or another cryptocurrency.

**Integrate and accept cryptocurrencies as payment method in minutes!**

Our plugin allows online shops, if using Woocommerce plugin, to easily accept and settle cryptocurrencies (X12) as a payment method when paying for goods or services.
The integration and configuration of our WooCommerce module is very simple and the payment gateway is fully automated - you get automatic payment confirmations and status updates.
To learn more about Bitcoin's benefits to your business and SkyPayment's solution, visit our website (link to skywallet).

**FUNCTIONALITY**

Extend the expiration time of your bill (if the payouts are in X12).
Accept minor underpayments automatically.
Refunds can be made directly from the invoice - without the involvement of the seller.

**HOW IT WORKS - EXAMPLE**

* A product in your online shop costs 10 euros.
* A customer wants to buy this product and pay with their X12 coins.
* An invoice will be created and displayed according to the current X12 / EUR exchange rate, how many X12 coins he has to pay for the item.
* For example, the current X12 / EUR rate is 5 EUR.
* So the customer will see the price 4.00 X12 coins or 20 EUR.
* Once the bill has been paid by the customer, you will receive a notification as a merchant and you will be credited XXXXXX (20 EUR less our% package) or XX X12.
